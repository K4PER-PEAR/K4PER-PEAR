Hi, Iâ€™m @K4PER-PEAR.
I'm an embedded engineer by trade, so that tends to be my focus for project selection. 
I'm currently designing hardware for the GBC (GameBoy Color) in the interest of replacing obsolete components. 
I also tinker with other interesting designs that I come across online, hopefully providing repositories of other useful designs.
