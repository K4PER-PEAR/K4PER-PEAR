Hi, Iâ€™m @K4PER-PEAR.
K4PER is my ham radio call sign, feel free to hit me up if you hear me over the air. 
I'm an embedded engineer by trade, so that tends to be my focus for project selection. 
I'm currently designing hardware for the GBC (GameBoy Color) in the interest of replacing obsolete components. 
I also tinker with other interesting designs that I come across online, hopefully providing repositories of other useful designs.
